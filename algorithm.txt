    -if it is then create edge above, to right and below
    -otherwise check if index is rightColumn
    -if it is then create edge above, to left and below
    -otherwise check if index is in bottom row between corners
    -if it is then create edge above, and to left/right
    -otherwise the index must be in the middle of the graph
    -this means that edges and be created for all directions above/below/left/right

    -increase x positioning
    -end the for loop
